      <p>Brute Force Attack is a 2d action combat game with 2 modes. Both modes have the player control a program generated by hackers trying to usurp the city from its tyrannical rulers.
        The first mode is a 1 v 1 arena mode where the player chooses to fight against a CPU or another human. Each player has access to  normal attack, which is a dash, a ranged attack, which can vary from a shotgun to a sword slash, depending on the character.
        Each character also has their unique special move.
        The second mode is the Story-focused, rogue-like mode where you aim to control the city. Each city area has nodes that you can conquer to gain Influence over the city, gain upgrades and progress the story. 
        Be warned, because the difficulty goes up each time you complete a node! And the game being a rogue-like, you lose all your progress if you die in battle, so upgrade and manage your character accordingly.
